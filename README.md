# Code-Refactor

## Project Description for Horiseon
To help Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. with search engine optimization and increased accessiblity in regards to their website, I set forth to refractor the source code provided by the client. I was able to accomplish these tasks by adding descriptive title elements, utilizing semantic elements, and further consolidating and curating the associated style sheet.  I was also able to increase functionality by fixing a broken navigation link.

## Installation
I cloned the clients source code to my own repository.  

## Usage
This webpage offers descriptions of the services provided for Horiseon. The descriptive and alternate tags added make the sight accesible to screen readers and improve searchability.
